> Introduction

Optimizing code is a key aspect of efficient programming. In this article, we'll explore how to enhance user validation logic in JavaScript. We'll compare two approaches, highlighting the benefits of choosing simplicity and performance.

> Problem

Complex User Validation Logic:
User validation often involves checking if a user's type matches specific criteria, leading to intricate if conditions.
&nbsp;

> Solution

JavaScript objects are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type. They allow us to model real-world entities or abstract concepts.

# Lets comparing the two approaches:

1. Traditional If-Else Statements:

```
const isValidUser = (type) => {
  if (type === 'admin' || type === 'employee' || type === 'customer'){
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};

```

2. Array Includes Method:

```
const isValidUser = (type) => ['admin', 'employee', 'customer'].includes(type);

```

> Summary

When comparing the two approaches, it's evident that using the array includes() method offers a cleaner and more concise solution for user validation. By embracing simplicity in your code, you not only improve readability but also enhance the performance of your JavaScript applications.
