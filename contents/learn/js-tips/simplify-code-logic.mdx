> Introduction

In JavaScript, handling conditional scenarios is a crucial aspect of coding. In this article, we'll explore two contrasting approaches to managing complex logic: traditional if-else statements and the modern object-based evaluation. By comparing these methods, we'll uncover the strengths and weaknesses of each, helping you make informed decisions when writing clean and efficient code.

> Problem

When faced with complex logic, developers often find themselves dealing with convoluted if-else statements. These constructs can quickly become difficult to manage and lead to code that's hard to understand and maintain.

&nbsp;

> Solution

JavaScript objects are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type. They allow us to model real-world entities or abstract concepts.

# Lets breakdown the problem:

1. If-Else Statements

```
const countMonthsByDurationType = (duration, durationType) => {
    let months = duration

    if (durationType === 4) {
        months = months * 12
    } else if (durationType === 2) {
        months = months / 4
    } else if (durationType === 1) {
        months = months / 30
    }

    months = Math.ceil(months)
    return months
}
```

Traditional if-else statements can become cumbersome when dealing with multiple conditions and potential nested structures.

2. The Object-Based Evaluation

```
const countMonthsByDurationType = (duration, durationType) => {
    const evaluate = {
        4: duration * 12,
        3: duration,
        2: duration / 4,
        1: duration / 30
    }
    return Math.ceil(evaluate[durationType])
}
```

By utilizing objects, you can significantly reduce the complexity of your code while maintaining clarity

## Comparing the Two Approaches:

### Readability:

- if-else: Readability can decline as conditions multiply.
- Object-Based Evaluation: Object structure enhances readability by encapsulating conditions.

### Maintainability:

- if-else: Modifications can lead to intricate and error-prone adjustments.
- Object-Based Evaluation: Centralized conditions simplify maintenance and updates.

### Efficiency:

- if-else: Execution time may increase with numerous checks.
- Object-Based Evaluation: Direct mapping accelerates execution and reduces redundant checks.

> Summary

In the world of conditional logic, the choice between traditional if-else statements and modern object-based evaluation comes down to a balance between readability, maintainability, and efficiency. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, you can make informed decisions that lead to cleaner, more elegant, and more maintainable code.

Hope this helps!
